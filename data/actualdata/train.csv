4,5.70051E+17,2015/2/23 18:41,American,RobGlaser,@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.
4,5.70051E+17,2015/2/23 18:40,American,faisal_tayebjee,@AmericanAir thanks to your attendant on flight for advising connect flight held.  Ran with kids and flight departed. Poor service at Miami
